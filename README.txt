SMTP Server: 
-For the server, all that is needed to operate it is the start button. 
-We start the server and listen for connections.
-Once we get a connection we wait for the password “ISTE121” to be entered correctly and then process the message to get it to the destination. 

SMTP Client:
- For the client, type in the IP in the GUI and connect to the server of your choosing. 
- Another GUI will pop up when accepted and will allow you to type in a username, password and email. 
- Press the login button to connect to a server.
- A message GUI should pop up if accepted. Type in your message and press send to send a message to the server.
